        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This strawberry cheesecake recipe makes a smooth, creamy vanilla cheesecake crowned with a brightly flavored, fresh strawberry topping. It’s made completely from scratch and made WITHOUT a water bath!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Cream cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Sour cream</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Graham Cracker Crumbs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Graham Cracker Crust</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the graham cracker crumbs and sugars, then stir in the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a springform pan. Try to get the crust as high up the sides as possible–this will help prevent cracks. Set this aside while you prepare your filling.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cheesecake Filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth, creamy, and well combined. Use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure everything is incorporated, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing only until just combined after each.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into your prepared springform pan and bake at 325F for 45-50 minutes or until the cheesecake is mostly done, but the center is still jiggly.</li>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it sit at room temperature until it no longer warm to the touch. Transfer the cheesecake to the fridge to chill for at least 6 hours, or if possible, overnight.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Strawberry Topping</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan, then add the water, lemon juice, and half of the strawberries. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Remove the sauce from the heat once the berries have broken down and the sauce begins to thicken.</li>
            <li>Stir in the butter and remaining berries until combined, then pour into a heatproof bowl to cool. You can place this in the fridge to speed up the cooling process.</li>
            <li>Spoon the cooled topping over the chilled cheesecake, slice, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
